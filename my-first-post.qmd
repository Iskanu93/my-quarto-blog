### The Role of Data Science Across Disciplines and Is It the Right Path for You?  

Have you chosen your career path already? Have you considered Data Science as an option? Or maybe you have never heard about Data Science. What if I told you that Data Science is an essential tool that needs to be implemented in your future career plans as well? If you heard that, don't rush to reject the idea that it is necessary for your future career.  

Considering that the market share of Data Science Platforms will triple by 2026 compared to 2021 (Market Research Report, 2022), this article introduces the importance of working with data in different fields and areas—be it banking, agriculture, education, or public policy.  

This 10-minute article can help you answer the following questions:  
- Am I passionate about Data Science?  
- In what ways can it benefit my future projects?  
- How can Data Science contribute to shaping a specific career path?

### Understanding Data Science  

First, I want to explain the nature of Data Science. Feel free to skip this section if you are already familiar with it and jump to the **Data Science in Various Disciplines** section.  

Before understanding the notion of Data Science, we must understand what data is and how it relates to you. As you know, the device you are using collects tons of raw information, such as time spent on a particular page, the number of downloads, and the names of installed applications. This digital information is organized into blocks called data. When processed and analyzed, data reveals meaningful insights and conclusions.  

Sometimes, you don't even realize how you contribute to data collection. For example:  
- Entering a library or a McDonald’s records information like time, the number of visitors, day, and weather conditions.  
- Banking transactions follow algorithms, which are analyzed by data scientists and presented to decision-makers.  

Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that enables us to extract, analyze, present, and predict data in ways that benefit businesses or solve real-world problems. It involves techniques such as data visualization, machine learning (ML), and predictive analytics, which support decision-making and shape business strategies.  

The tools used in Data Science are not limited to big corporations; they are applicable across various fields, helping uncover new patterns and create innovative solutions.

### Data Science in Various Disciplines  

### Humanities & Social Sciences  
Data Science is in demand in humanities subjects, including history and languages. It can even help us conserve languages that are at risk of being lost. A good example is the **Chagatai language**—almost an extinct language of the Turkic language tree.  

The Chagatai language was used for communication and documentation by educated individuals, leaving invaluable primary sources for contemporary historians to understand the past. However, due to the lack of individuals who can read and write in Chagatai, there is a high risk of leaving this history forgotten.  

Fortunately, Data Science techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) offer a solution to preserve the region's historical legacy. Considering that it is nearly impossible to educate many people in the Chagatai language, there is an opportunity to digitize historical texts and teach an ML model to read, transcribe, and even translate the language. Thus, contemporary Turkologists, such as Talant Mawkenuli (University of Washington, n.d.), need data scientists to assist them in preserving this extinct language, which will lead to new findings in the history of Central Asia.

### Business & Economics  
Data Science is already embedded in everyday business activities, from Amazon purchases to Netflix recommendations. But let’s look at an area you are likely to encounter: **banking**.  

In the banking industry, competition often relies on innovative strategies backed by data insights. Modern banking operations generate vast amounts of transactional data, stored in databases and analyzed using data analytics and ML models.  

These insights are presented to decision-makers, who integrate them into business strategies. For example, predictive analytics can help banks identify customers at risk of defaulting on loans or predict future trends in investments. This collaboration between data scientists and business strategists drives innovation and growth.

### Engineering & Technology  
Even in well-established fields like engineering, Data Science plays a crucial role. Consider the **oil and gas industry**.  

In this industry, every transfer of oil and gas is measured and stored as data. Predictive models powered by machine learning are used to forecast consumption patterns. For example, gasoline consumption is analyzed to optimize delivery schedules, minimizing costs and ensuring efficient supply chains.  

These predictions help companies meet demand while avoiding overproduction or waste, showcasing the practical applications of Data Science in engineering.

### Building a Career in Data Science  

Data Science is a versatile field, relevant across disciplines—be it humanities, business, or engineering. These examples show the impact Data Science has on solving problems and advancing industries.  

If you are exploring career options, consider whether Data Science excites you. One path could lead to becoming a Data Scientist, a highly sought-after profession. Alternatively, you could integrate Data Science into your existing career, whether through data-driven decision-making or by leveraging insights to improve outcomes.  

Regardless of your choice, reflecting on the importance of Data Science is essential for staying relevant in today’s data-driven world.

### Final Thoughts  

Choose a career path that aligns with your interests and passion, even as you consider the growing role of Data Science. Whether you aim to preserve languages, optimize business strategies, or innovate in engineering, Data Science can empower you to achieve your goals.
